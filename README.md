# MONSTERS WEBSITE
## Learning Goals
Access information from an API using a GET request and use it to update the DOM
Listen for user events and update the DOM in response
Send data to an API using a POST request

## Deliverables
When the page loads, show the first 50 monsters. Each monster's name, age, and description should be shown.
Above your list of monsters, you should have a form to create a new monster. You should have fields for name, age, and description, and a 'Create Monster Button'. When you click the button, the monster should be added to the list and saved in the API.
